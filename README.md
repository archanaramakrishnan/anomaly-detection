EECS 731 Data Science | Project 6 - D(St)reams of Anomalies

Navigate to **notebooks > [DreamsOfAnomalies.ipynb](https://github.com/archanaramakrishnan/anomaly-detection/blob/master/notebooks/DreamsOfAnomalies.ipynb) to view the Jupyter Notebook**
I used Local Outlier Factor and Isolation Forest models to detect anomalies in the key hold data which indicate the change in users. LOF gave much better results than Isolation Forest.

# Introduction to Data Science, Project 6: D(St)reams of Anomalies
------------
   The real world does not slow down for bad data
1.  Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2.  Download the benchmark data set from
https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab  or
https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data
3.  Load the  one  of the data set into panda data frames
4.  Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
5.  Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the  anomalies  using the other columns as features
6.  Document your process and results
7.  Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
